## Learning Philosophy

**"I believe learning development means not just coding, but understanding how everything connects — frontend, backend, tools, and logic."**

### My Approach
1. **Learn by Building:** Every concept is practiced through real projects
2. **Document Everything:** Clear README files, code comments, and learning notes
3. **Consistency Over Intensity:** Daily commits and steady progress
4. **Quality Over Quantity:** Focus on understanding rather than just completing tasks
5. **Industry Alignment:** Following real-world best practices from day one

---

## Day-by-Day Log

### Day 1 — Environment Setup
**Date:** [Current Date]

**What I Accomplished:**
- Installed development environment: VS Code, Node.js, Git, JDK 21, Postman
- Configured `JAVA_HOME` and system PATH variables
- Learned frontend vs backend architecture
- Understood Java compilation process (source → bytecode → JVM execution)
- Explored build tools: Maven and Gradle
- Tested public API using Postman (`jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`)

**Key Learnings:**
- How backend APIs work independently of frontend
- Role of environment variables in Java development
- Difference between compiled (Java) and interpreted (JavaScript) languages
- Importance of build tools in dependency management

**Tools Verified:**
| Tool | Version | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| VS Code | Latest |  Installed |
| Node.js | v20.x |  Installed |
| Git | v2.x |  Installed |
| JDK | 21 |  Installed |
| Postman | Latest |  Installed |

- Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Use consistent code formatting

### Version Control
- Commit daily with descriptive messages
- Use feature branches for new functionality
- Write detailed commit messages explaining "why" not just "what"
- Keep commit history clean and meaningful

### Documentation
- Every project has a comprehensive README
- Include setup instructions, dependencies, and usage examples
- Add screenshots/GIFs for UI projects
