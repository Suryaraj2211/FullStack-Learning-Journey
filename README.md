# Full Stack Developer Learning Journey - Surya PM

Welcome to my **Full Stack Development Learning Journey**  
This repository tracks my **daily progress** as I learn and build projects using  
**React (Frontend)** + **Java / Spring Boot (Backend)** + **Databases (MongoDB / MySQL)**.

---

## Day 1 — Environment Setup

**What I did today:**
- Installed all base tools:  
 **VS Code**, **Node.js**, **Git**, **JDK 21**, **Postman**
- Set up `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables
- Understood what is **Frontend** vs **Backend**
- Learned how **Java compiles → bytecode → JVM → runs**
- Explored **Maven** and **Gradle** (build tools)
- Practiced testing an API in **Postman** (without frontend)

**Example Tested API:**  
`GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`

Verified response JSON successfully received in Postman.

## Tools Installed & Configured
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **VS Code** | Code Editor (for JS + Java) |
| **Node.js** | JavaScript runtime for frontend builds |
| **Git** | Version control system |
| **GitHub** | To track and showcase my daily progress |
| **JDK 21** | Java Development Kit |
| **Postman** | API testing tool |
| **Maven / Gradle** | Java project build tools |

---

## Key Learnings
- How backend works without a frontend (using Postman)
- What `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` actually do
- What **bytecode** and **machine code** mean in Java
- Difference between **Java (compiled)** and **JavaScript (interpreted)**
- Role of **Maven & Gradle** in managing Java dependencies

## My Learning Mindset
> “I believe learning development means not just coding,  
> but understanding *how everything connects — frontend, backend, tools, and logic.*”

This repo is my daily journal — each folder = one day’s progress.  
I’ll be pushing commits regularly to track my improvement and consistency.
