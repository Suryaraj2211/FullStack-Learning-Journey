Day 6 – Live Typing App

Today I built a small Live Typing App using basic HTML and JavaScript.
The goal was simple: whatever I type in the input box should immediately appear on the screen.

What I practiced

Reading input values using JavaScript

Updating text on the page without refresh

Using the oninput event for live updates

Basic interaction between HTML and JavaScript (DOM)

How the app works

I type something inside the input box

JavaScript reads the typed value

The same text appears instantly inside the paragraph

The output keeps updating as I type

It feels like a small version of how live search bars or chat apps respond as we type.

Why this project is useful

This small exercise helped me understand:

How JavaScript connects with HTML

How events work

How real-time updates happen on a webpage

This is a basic but important step towards building interactive UI and future frontend work.
